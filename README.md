## Introduction

### Dataset Description 

This dataset collects information
from 100k medical appointments in
Brazil and is focused on the question
of whether or not patients show up
for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are
included in each row.
● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on
what day the patient set up their
appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the
location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates
whether or not the patient is
enrolled in Brasilian welfare
program Bolsa Família.

● Be careful about the encoding
of the last column: it says ‘No’ if
the patient showed up to their
appointment 


● We will try to find out if there is any characteristics (columns) have any effect on patients attendance ,

throught the analysis we will compare the attendace and other characteristics to see if any of those characteristics 

effect the attendance of the patient
